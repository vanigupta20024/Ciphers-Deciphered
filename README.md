Ciphers implemented in the application are:

  * Caesar Cipher
  * Autokey Cipher
  * Vignere Cipher
  * Playfair Cipher
  * Beaufort Cipher
  * Vignere Autokey Cipher
  * Atbash Cipher
  * Homophonic Substitution Cipher
  * Beaufort Autokey Cipher
  * Columnar Transposition Cipher
  * Railfence Cipher
  * Morse Code

***Feel free to add or contribute any more ciphers of your choice.***
